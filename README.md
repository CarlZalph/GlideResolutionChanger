# GlideResolutionChanger
Sets the glide wrapper's hardcoded values to a custom one.

Glide wrapper is developed by Sven.
As of this time, it may be found at:
http://www.svenswrapper.de/english/downloads.html

This software existing doesn't mean that Sven endorses or promotes this software.

This software supports the following versions for:

GlideDLL: 1.4e (1.4.4.21), D2SE's 1.4e (1.4.6.1)

GlideEXE: 1.4e (2.0.1.24), D2SE's 1.4e (2.0.1.24)

# How to use
Place GlideResolutionChanger.exe in the same folder as the install location for the glide wrapper.

Run the software, and you should be prompted to input a desired resolution.

Type in "1234 432" and the program will assume you want a 1234x432 resolution.

After it applies, run the glide's init program and go to the settings tab, and the last entry for the 'static size' should be what you typed in.

Note that if the string says "<!BIG!>" then that is fine, your values are still working, and the window should appear fine provided the setting isn't bigger than your monitor's actual display resolution.  This is merely a fallback string in case the display string is too long for the patched area to hold.

The default values for the glide wrapper is 1600x1200 if you want to revert it back to normal.  You may also reinstall glide to remove any changes.


# Private servers and anticheats
I'm not sure if the private servers' anticheats will trigger based on these edits.  Please consult with your server administration team before doing any modifications of files.

I do not know if these edits will flag you for bans on the authentic live servers.  I would assume not, but I make no guarantees about anything.  Use at your own risk.
